# CNN used to detect Covid19 as well as Viral Pneumonia cases.

This notebook shows the steps that I followed to differents models of a CNN capable of detecting Covid19 and Viral Pneumonia cases from lungs X-RAYS. I used many models to compare between them, some models were capable to make the difference between healthy lungs and lungs of Covid19 patients, but the detection of lungs with Viral Pneumonia was complicated because it's close to Covid19. Here is the link of the data that I used : https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
